## Research Question
Can we predict cardiovascular disease risk and diabetes onset using sleep patterns and identify actionable sleep interventions that reduce chronic disease risk by 20% or more?

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between sleep patterns and chronic disease risk, specifically focusing on cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Using real CDC NHANES 2017-2018 data with 9,254 participants, we develop predictive models and provide actionable sleep recommendations that can significantly reduce disease risk.
